      <description>Autocorrelation is a concept in statistics and signal processing used to measure the correlation of a signal with itself at different time lags. In other words, autocorrelation determines the similarity of the signal at one time point compared to previous time points.&#xA;Formula&#xD;#&#xD;The autocorrelation of a signal \( x(t) \) at a time lag \( \tau \) is defined as:&#xA;\[ R(\tau) = \mathbb{E}[x(t) \cdot x(t + \tau)] \] Where:</description>

      <description>In signal processing, the concepts of stationary and non-stationary are used to describe the properties of a signal over time.&#xA;Stationary Signal&#xD;#&#xD;A signal is called stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. These statistical properties include mean, variance, and correlation functions. There are two types of stationarity:&#xA;Weak Stationarity (or Wide-Sense Stationarity): The signal has a constant mean and variance over time, and the correlation function depends only on the time difference between two points, not on the specific time points themselves.</description>
