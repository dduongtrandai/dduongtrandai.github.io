Welcome to my personal blog! In this blog, Iâ€™ll share about two important fields: Electroencephalography (EEG). Letâ€™s explore the fascinating content below:

1. Electroencephalography (EEG) EEG records the brainâ€™s electrical activity by placing electrodes on the scalp. Itâ€™s a crucial area of research in neuroscience and mental health. Topics related to EEG include:
2. Brain wave analysis: Studying brain waves to understand psychological states and health.
3. Detecting variations: Using EEG to identify changes in brain activity, such as alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves.
4. Medical applications: EEG is used for diagnosing brain disorders, monitoring patient conditions, and evaluating treatment effectiveness.
