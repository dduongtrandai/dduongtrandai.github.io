**Autocorrelation** is a concept in statistics and signal processing used to measure the correlation of a signal with itself at different time lags. In other words, autocorrelation determines the similarity of the signal at one time point compared to previous time points.

### Formula

The autocorrelation of a signal \( x(t) \) at a time lag \( \tau \) is defined as:

\[ R(\tau) = \mathbb{E}[x(t) \cdot x(t + \tau)] \]

Where:

- \( R(\tau) \) is the autocorrelation function at time lag \( \tau \).
- \( x(t) \) is the signal at time \( t \).
- \( x(t + \tau) \) is the signal at time \( t + \tau \).
- \( \mathbb{E} \) denotes the expected value.

### Applications

1. **Signal Analysis**: Autocorrelation is used to analyze the characteristics of signals, such as finding repeating cycles or frequencies in the signal.
2. **Audio Processing**: In the field of audio, autocorrelation can help identify features of sounds, such as the fundamental frequency of a voice.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Autocorrelation is used in time series analysis to determine the relationship between values in the series at different times.
4. **Filtering and Signal Detection**: Autocorrelation is also used in signal filtering and pattern detection in various fields, including telecommunications and radar.

Autocorrelation is an important tool in signal analysis and statistics, helping to better understand the structure and characteristics of data.
